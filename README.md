# Code_Examples

This repo serves as a collection of past Python/R scripts I have completed to demonstrate my coding ability. I recommend starting with "Data_Science_Examples" and looking at NCAA_Kaggle, Predicting_NFL, and IISE_Data_Analytics. These projects have full writeups/reports. In addition to my data science projects, I added in other scripts roughly categorized as learning and random. Learning scripts are generally slightly modified from exterior sources as a way for me to understand the methods better. Random projects encompass other fun projects I have completed. A couple examples are a web-scraper for college football data, a text-to-voice spelling bee trainer, and some mathy examples generally based off Numberphile and 3Blue1Brown videos. 

Due to restrictions surrounding my work at MSU, some code documented on my resume will not appear here. This is due to embargo periods, or restrictions by the project organizer. I am happy to discuss any of these codes in an interview, but cannot share them on Github. 

Thanks for stopping by!
