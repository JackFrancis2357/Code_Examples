# Heuristics in Optimization Final Project -- Genetic Algorithm

For our final project in Heuristics to Optimization, my teammate and I decided to use a series of heuristics, including the Genetic Algorithm to solve a Kaggle optimization challenge, which can be found here <https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019>. In the problem, Santa is trying to solve a scheduling problem to identify when the best time to invite families to the North Pole. Each family has a series of preferred visit days and based on Santa's choice he will incur a cost. There are also limitations on how many families can come each day, so the problem ends up being quite challenging.

We used Guided Local Search, Random Local Search, and the Genetic Algorithm to find an optimal solution for Santa's problem. We find that the Genetic Algorithm provides the highest-quality solution for the problem. The full writeup of the problem along with code can be found in the pdf above.
