# IISE DAIS Analytics Competition

The objective of the competition was to analyze the causes of fatal crashes in the United States and provide suggestions to lawmakers on how to reduce the likelihood of fatal crashes occurring. The project involved looking at types of vehicles, driver behavior, and driving circumstances that were seen to be highly correlated with fatal crashes based on data from 2018.
